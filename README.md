# multimodel-ml-challenges
This repository illustrates some ML challenges of training a custom ML (multiclass text classification) model for each user.  

This repository complements my presentation at [Data Science fwdays'21](https://fwdays.com/en/event/data-science-fwdays-2021) conference: Custom ML Models for Each User.

When training a separate model for each user, there are multiple training data sets each of its own size.

Here you can find: how different model metrics change with training data set size.

The data set used is based on [GitHub Issue Classification tutorial](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/machine-learning/tutorials/github-issue-classification.md) that illistrates ML.NET usage.
